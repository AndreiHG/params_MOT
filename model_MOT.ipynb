    "The high level objective of this project is to get the temperature of a gas of molecules or atoms trapped in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). For this, the first goal is to fit images of the MOT taken on a CCD camera to 2D Gaussians, which is our basic guess for its shape. On top of shape we also model multiple sources of uncertainty, from statistical uncertainty in our 2D Gaussian guess to uncertainties arising from shot noise, readout noise or scattered light noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "To actually get the temeprature of the gas we physically have to release the molecules/atoms from the trap and let them expand. From the expansion rate we can then infer the temeprature. Thus, the second goal is to analyze multiple such images taken at different times after the release from the trap. For each moment in time we use our model to fit parameters such as $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{y}}$, i.e. the widths of the MOT, which we then use to obtain the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally the package should be felxible enough to be used on any MOT image. Members from our group have data for MOTs made from molecules of CaF, or from atoms of Rb or K. We build our package by first testing it on the molecular MOT, since that is the noisiest one and it also lends itself to expansions of the model such as considering the slosh of particles in the trap itself, which is not negligible in this case (in other words all trapped molecules have a non negligible initial velocity in the same direction)."
